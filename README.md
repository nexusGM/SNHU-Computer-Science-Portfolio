### CS-250 Software Developement Lifecycle
#### Sprint Review and Retrospective

- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it is essential to engage in effective communication with the user, understand their requirements, and develop a deep understanding of their goals and objectives. It is important to ask questions, clarify expectations, and document feedback to ensure that the final product meets the user's needs. Creating user stories is a powerful tool in this regard, as it helps to identify the key requirements of the user and develop a clear understanding of what the software should do and how it should function. User stories provide a structured approach to understanding user needs and incorporating them into the software development process.


- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - Approaching program development requires a structured and iterative approach that involves multiple stages of planning, design, testing, and deployment. It is important to gather requirements, create a clear plan, develop a design that meets those requirements, test the program, and then deploy it to users. Agile processes are an effective way to approach program development, as they prioritize flexibility and collaboration, emphasize iterative development, and encourage frequent communication and feedback between developers and users. Agile processes like Scrum, Kanban, and XP can all help ensure that the development process is flexible, efficient, and effective.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  - Being a good team member in software development involves many different qualities and skills. Effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving are all critical aspects of being a good team member. It is important to be open to feedback, work well with others, and take a proactive approach to resolving issues and addressing challenges. Good team members are also committed to quality, take pride in their work, and have a strong work ethic. Ultimately, being a good team member in software development means being committed to the success of the project and working collaboratively with others to achieve that success.
