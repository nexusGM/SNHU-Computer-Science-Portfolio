### CS-250 Software Developement Lifecycle
#### Sprint Review and Retrospective

- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it is essential to engage in effective communication with the user, understand their requirements, and develop a deep understanding of their goals and objectives. It is important to ask questions, clarify expectations, and document feedback to ensure that the final product meets the user's needs. Creating user stories is a powerful tool in this regard, as it helps to identify the key requirements of the user and develop a clear understanding of what the software should do and how it should function. User stories provide a structured approach to understanding user needs and incorporating them into the software development process.


- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - Approaching program development requires a structured and iterative approach that involves multiple stages of planning, design, testing, and deployment. It is important to gather requirements, create a clear plan, develop a design that meets those requirements, test the program, and then deploy it to users. Agile processes are an effective way to approach program development, as they prioritize flexibility and collaboration, emphasize iterative development, and encourage frequent communication and feedback between developers and users. Agile processes like Scrum, Kanban, and XP can all help ensure that the development process is flexible, efficient, and effective.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  - Being a good team member in software development involves many different qualities and skills. Effective communication, collaboration, and problem-solving are all critical aspects of being a good team member. It is important to be open to feedback, work well with others, and take a proactive approach to resolving issues and addressing challenges. Good team members are also committed to quality, take pride in their work, and have a strong work ethic. Ultimately, being a good team member in software development means being committed to the success of the project and working collaboratively with others to achieve that success.

### CS-210 Programming Languages
#### Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program

##### Project Summary and Problem Solved

- The project is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which analyzes text records generated throughout the day, listing items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. The program must incorporate the requested functionality of providing the frequency of specific items, a list of all items with their frequency, a histogram showing the frequency of each item, and the ability to create a backup file with the accumulated data.

- The Corner Grocer needed a program to help them rearrange their produce section by identifying how often items were purchased. This program solves that problem by analyzing the text records generated throughout the day and providing the frequency of each item purchased.

##### What was done particularly well

- The use of classes with public and private sections.
- Implementation of maps to store and retrieve data.

##### Areas for Improvement

- The code could be enhanced by adding input validation and error handling to anticipate, detect, and respond to run-time and user errors.
- The code could be made more efficient by optimizing data structures and algorithms.

##### Challenges and Solutions

- The implementation of the histogram was a challenging piece of code.

- The challenges were overcome by researching and experimenting with different approaches until an efficient and effective solution was found.
  
- Various resources and tools, such as zyBooks and Visual Studio 2019, were used to support the development of the program.
  
##### Transferable Skills

- Writing professional, well-documented, and readable code
- Utilizing various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code
- Implementing classes and maps.
  

##### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

- Industry-standard best practices were applied, such as using appropriate naming conventions and in-line comments to enhance readability and maintainability. The code was also designed to be adaptable by utilizing classes and maps, which allow for easy modification and expansion.
