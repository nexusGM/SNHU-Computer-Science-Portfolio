## CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization
### Design Decisions: Justification of the 3D Scene Development

**1. How do I approach designing software?**
   - While designing software, I prioritize functionality combined with user experience. Using the 3D scene as an example, every object has both an aesthetic and functional value, each carefully chosen to convey a specific message or purpose.

**2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
   - I learned to combine different basic shapes to create more complex structures, like constructing a lamp using cones, a sphere, and cylinders. Additionally, the design choices conveyed deeper meanings, improving storytelling skills.

**3. What design process did you follow for your project work?**
   - My design process began with visualizing a workspace, symbolizing creativity and growth. From there, each object added was purposeful, be it for functionality or symbolic representation.

**4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
   - The principles of blending functionality with storytelling and creating complexity from simplicity can be invaluable in future software or game design projects.

**5. How do I approach developing programs?**
   - I approach programming by first understanding the end goal, breaking down the task into modular functions, and prioritizing user interactivity.

**6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
   - I utilized custom functions for modularity and incorporated user controls to make the scene interactive.

**7. How did iteration factor into your development?**
   - Iteration was crucial. The pile of garbage, which was a failed attempt at a sphere, showcases the iterative nature of development, where failures become stepping stones.

**8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
   - The project pushed me to continuously reflect on my coding practices. As the scene evolved, I recognized areas where functions could be more modular, enhancing code efficiency.

**9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
   - Computer science offers the tools and methodologies to bring visions to life, be it a 3D scene or complex software.

**10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
   - Computational graphics teach the importance of blending technical prowess with creativity, a valuable combination in fields like game design, virtual reality, and more.

**11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
   - Mastery in computational graphics can open doors to careers in animation, game development, and VR/AR development. Understanding user interactivity can also pave the way for UX/UI design roles.
